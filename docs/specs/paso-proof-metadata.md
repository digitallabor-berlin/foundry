# Metadata Module

## Abstract

This document specifies how Attestation Providers serve verifiable credential metadata for PaSO Credentials, and how Wallets retrieve, verify, store, and renew it. It defines the `credential_metadata_uri` extension to [OID4VCI], the signed credential metadata JWT format, the `transaction_data_types` structure within credential metadata, and the claims metadata structure used to describe transaction data payloads. It further defines an ad-hoc mechanism by which the same transaction data type metadata can alternatively be supplied within a `transaction_data` entry itself, as a JWT signed by the credential's issuer.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

[OID4VCI] serves credential metadata as unsigned JSON from the Credential Issuer Metadata endpoint. Unsigned metadata cannot be used as evidence in dispute resolution, and the Wallet cannot verify that it has not been tampered with. This module defines a mechanism for serving credential metadata as a signed JWT from a dedicated URI, binding the metadata to the credential and its issuer.

The signed credential metadata is the mechanism by which the Wallet determines which transaction data types a PaSO Credential supports, as required by [PaSO Core] Section 7.

In addition, this module defines an ad-hoc channel (Section 5) by which the metadata for a single transaction data type can be supplied within the `transaction_data` entry itself, as a JWT signed by the Attestation Provider. This allows an Attestation Provider to supply transaction-specific or updated metadata without rotating the signed credential metadata JWT.

### 1.2 Requirements Notation

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and [RFC8174] when, and only when, they are written in all capital letters.

## 2 Credential Metadata URI

This section defines an extension to [OID4VCI] Credential Issuer Metadata for serving signed credential metadata.

- **`credential_metadata_uri`**: **OPTIONAL** (string). A new parameter for entries in `credential_configurations_supported` as defined in [OID4VCI] Section 12.2.4. A URL that serves the `credential_metadata` object as defined in [OID4VCI] Section 12.2.4, extended with `transaction_data_types` per Section 3.

The Attestation Provider **SHALL** include a `credential_metadata_uri` in each PaSO Credential configuration within the Credential Issuer Metadata and **SHALL** serve the credential metadata at that URI.

When fetching from a `credential_metadata_uri`, the Wallet **SHALL** include an `Accept` header and an `Accept-Language` header per [OID4VCI] Section 12.2.2. If the `Accept` header is absent or does not express a preference, the Attestation Provider **SHALL** default to `application/json`. The Attestation Provider **MAY** refuse requests without an `Accept-Language` header; if it does, it **SHALL** respond with HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request).

- `Accept: application/json` — The Attestation Provider **SHALL** return the credential metadata as a plain JSON object, i.e. the `credential_metadata` object extended with `transaction_data_types` per Section 3, without the JWT payload structure defined in Section 4. Note that per Section 3, the Wallet cannot rely on this unsigned form for PaSO Credentials.
- `Accept: application/jwt` — The Attestation Provider **SHALL** return the credential metadata as a signed JWT per Section 4.

The Attestation Provider **MAY** serve one or more locales per signed JWT. The Attestation Provider **SHALL** include at least the first supported locale from the `Accept-Language` header and **MAY** include additional locales.

## 3 Transaction Data Types in Credential Metadata

The credential metadata for a PaSO Credential **SHALL** include the following parameter:

- **`transaction_data_types`**: **REQUIRED** (object). An object where each key is a transaction data type identifier following the `urn:paso:sca:<domain>:<suffix>:<version>` structure defined in [PaSO Core] Section 5.2, and each value is an object containing:
  - **`claims`**: **REQUIRED**. Array of claim metadata objects per Section 3.1.
  - **`ui_labels`**: **REQUIRED** when the credential is issued to a Wallet that does not have a dedicated UI for the transaction data type; **OPTIONAL** otherwise. Object providing localised strings for the consent UI per Section 3.2.
  - Additional parameters **MAY** be defined and used. The Wallet **MUST** ignore any unrecognised parameters.

A PaSO Credential **SHALL NOT** be accepted by the Wallet unless its credential metadata was obtained as a signed JWT from the `credential_metadata_uri` and successfully verified per Section 7. The signed credential metadata JWT is the authoritative source for the credential metadata, except that ad-hoc transaction data metadata supplied per Section 5 takes precedence for the individual transaction it accompanies; the Wallet **SHALL NOT** use unsigned credential metadata from the Credential Issuer Metadata endpoint for PaSO Credentials.

If, during issuance, the Wallet determines that a credential is a PaSO Credential but does not hold a validly signed credential metadata JWT for it, the Wallet **SHALL** reject the issuance and inform the user.

### 3.1 Claims Metadata

Each entry in `transaction_data_types` **MUST** supply metadata for each claim of the transaction data payload using the `claims` parameter. Each claim metadata object uses the structure defined in [OID4VCI] Appendix B.2, with the following differences:

- The `path` parameter resolves against the `transaction_data` `payload` object, not against the credential itself.
- A `value_type` parameter (string) **MAY** be added to claim objects that have a `display` array. It indicates how the Wallet **SHALL** format the claim value for display. If omitted, the value is treated as plain text and **MUST** be a string. The `value_type` parameter **MUST NOT** be used on claims without a `display` array. The set of supported value types is defined by the applicable Transaction Data Type Rulebook or by other PaSO specifications.
- A `display_type` parameter (string) **MAY** be added to `display` entry objects. It governs how the Wallet **SHALL** format the `name` text of that display entry, applying the same rendering rules as the corresponding `value_type` but to the label. If omitted, the label is plain text.

Claims that are relevant to the user's consent **MUST** include a `display` array with entries for the locales served in that signed JWT. Claims without a `display` array **MUST** be internal values irrelevant to the user's consent.

The `display` entries and `value_type` provide default rendering hints. The applicable Transaction Data Type Rulebook defines the semantic meaning of each claim; a Wallet that implements a specific rulebook **MAY** provide its own labels or visual representations in place of the metadata-supplied `display` entries, provided the meaning remains clear and unmistakable to the user.

### 3.2 UI Labels

Each entry in `transaction_data_types` **MAY** include a `ui_labels` object providing localised strings for consent UI elements. The `ui_labels` object is a set of key-value pairs where each key is a UI element identifier and each value is an array of objects containing:

- `locale`: **OPTIONAL**. A [RFC5646] language tag. Entries without `locale` serve as defaults.
- `value`: The localised string.
- `value_type`: **OPTIONAL**. A `value_type` as defined in Section 3.1 governing how the Wallet formats the `value`. If omitted, treated as plain text.

The following UI element identifiers are defined by this specification:

- **`affirmative_action_label`**: Label for the confirmation action (e.g., "Confirm Payment").
- **`denial_action_label`**: Label for the denial action. If absent, the Wallet **SHALL** provide its own.
- **`transaction_title`**: Title for the consent screen. If absent, the Wallet **MAY** provide its own.
- **`security_hint`**: A security hint displayed to the user. When present, the Wallet **SHALL** display it exactly as provided and **SHALL NOT** alter or remove it.

Additional UI element identifiers **MAY** be defined by Transaction Data Type Rulebooks or other PaSO specifications. The Wallet **SHALL** ignore any unrecognised UI element identifiers.

As with claims, the applicable Transaction Data Type Rulebook defines the semantic meaning of each UI element identifier. A Wallet that implements a specific rulebook **MAY** replace `ui_labels` text with its own labels or visual representations, provided the meaning remains clear and unmistakable to the user. The `security_hint` is an exception: it **SHALL** always be displayed exactly as provided.

## 4 Signed Credential Metadata JWT

When the Wallet requests `Accept: application/jwt`, the Attestation Provider **SHALL** return the credential metadata as a signed JWT with the following structure:

- The JOSE header **SHALL** include:
  - `typ`: set to `credential-metadata+jwt`.
  - `x5c`: **REQUIRED** when the credential's issuer keys are published as an x5c certificate chain. The Attestation Provider's certificate chain.
  - `kid`: **REQUIRED** when the credential's issuer keys are instead published in a key set resolved via the credential format's issuer-key mechanism (e.g., [SD-JWT-VC] issuer metadata). Identifies the signing key within that key set. In this case, `x5c` **SHALL NOT** be used.
- The JWT payload **SHALL** include:
  - `iss`: **REQUIRED**. The Credential Issuer Identifier.
  - `sub`: **REQUIRED**. The credential type identifier as defined by the credential format: the `vct` claim value for [SD-JWT-VC], or the `docType` value of the mobile security object (MSO) for [mdoc].
  - `format`: **REQUIRED**. The credential format identifier as defined in [OID4VCI] (e.g., `dc+sd-jwt`, `mso_mdoc`).
  - `iat`: **REQUIRED**. Issuance time.
  - `exp`: **REQUIRED**. Expiration time. The Attestation Provider **SHOULD** set a validity period appropriate for the rate of metadata change.
  - `credential_metadata_uri`: **REQUIRED**. The URL from which this JWT was served and from which the Wallet **SHALL** re-fetch it upon renewal.
  - `credential_metadata`: **REQUIRED**. The `credential_metadata` object as defined in [OID4VCI] Section 12.2.4, extended with `transaction_data_types` per Section 3.
- The JWT **SHALL** be signed using an algorithm appropriate for the signing key: the key in the `x5c` leaf certificate, or the key set key identified by `kid`.

The Attestation Provider **SHALL** rotate signed credential metadata JWTs before their `exp` time and **SHOULD** set `exp` values that balance freshness against unnecessary network traffic.

The Wallet **MAY** refuse issuance if the returned metadata does not contain any locale compatible with its locale priority list.

## 5 Ad-hoc Transaction Data Metadata

This section defines an alternative mechanism for supplying transaction data type metadata. Instead of relying solely on the corresponding entry in the signed credential metadata JWT, the metadata for a transaction data type **MAY** be supplied ad hoc within the `transaction_data` entry itself, as a JWT signed by the Attestation Provider of the targeted PaSO Credential. This mechanism applies to PaSO Credentials of every credential format supported by [PaSO Core], including [SD-JWT-VC] and [mdoc]; only the values of the `sub` and `format` claims (Section 5.2) are format-specific.

### 5.1 The `metadata` Parameter

PaSO extends the [OID4VP] `transaction_data` entry with the following parameter, in addition to the `payload` parameter defined in [PaSO Core] Section 7.1:

- **`metadata`**: **OPTIONAL** (string). An ad-hoc metadata JWT as defined in Section 5.2, signed by the Attestation Provider of the targeted PaSO Credential. The Relying Party obtains the ad-hoc metadata JWT from the Attestation Provider; the mechanism by which it does so is out of scope of this specification.

### 5.2 Ad-hoc Metadata JWT

The ad-hoc metadata JWT **SHALL** have the following structure:

- The JOSE header **SHALL** include:
  - `typ`: set to `adhoc-transaction-metadata+jwt`.
  - `x5c`: **REQUIRED** when the credential's issuer keys are published as an x5c certificate chain. The Attestation Provider's certificate chain.
  - `kid`: **REQUIRED** when the credential's issuer keys are instead published in a key set resolved via the credential format's issuer-key mechanism (e.g., [SD-JWT-VC] issuer metadata). Identifies the signing key within that key set. In this case, `x5c` **SHALL NOT** be used.
- The JWT payload **SHALL** include:
  - `iss`: **REQUIRED**. The Credential Issuer Identifier.
  - `sub`: **REQUIRED**. The credential type identifier as defined by the credential format: the `vct` claim value for [SD-JWT-VC], or the `docType` value of the mobile security object (MSO) for [mdoc].
  - `format`: **REQUIRED**. The credential format identifier as defined in [OID4VCI] (e.g., `dc+sd-jwt`, `mso_mdoc`).
  - `iat`: **REQUIRED**. Issuance time.
  - `exp`: **REQUIRED**. Expiration time. The Attestation Provider **SHOULD** choose a validity period that bounds how long Relying Parties can cache and reuse the JWT.
  - `transaction_data_type`: **REQUIRED**. The transaction data type identifier the metadata applies to, following the structure defined in [PaSO Core] Section 5.2. It **SHALL** equal the `type` of the enclosing `transaction_data` entry.
  - `metadata`: **REQUIRED**. An object with the same structure as a single `transaction_data_types` entry value as defined in Section 3, i.e. containing `claims` per Section 3.1, `ui_labels` per Section 3.2 where applicable, and any additional parameters. The requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 apply unchanged.
- The JWT **SHALL** be signed using an algorithm appropriate for the signing key: the key in the `x5c` leaf certificate, or the key set key identified by `kid`.

The credential type identifier bound by `sub` is unrelated to the device-signed namespace `urn:paso:sca:1` defined in [PaSO Core] Section 6.3: that namespace identifies where the SCA response claims are placed within an mdoc presentation and is not a credential type identifier. For an [mdoc] PaSO Credential, `sub` carries the credential's `docType` and `format` is `mso_mdoc`.

### 5.3 Verification

When a PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entry contains a `metadata` parameter, the Wallet **SHALL** verify the ad-hoc metadata JWT as follows before relying on it:

1. Verify that the `typ` JOSE header parameter is `adhoc-transaction-metadata+jwt`.
2. Verify the JWT signature.
3. Verify the signing key trust:
   - When the credential's issuer keys are x5c-based, verify the `x5c` certificate chain in the JOSE header against the Wallet's trust store.
   - Otherwise, verify that the JWT is signed by a key from the credential issuer's published key set, identified by the `kid` JOSE header parameter and resolved via the credential format's issuer-key mechanism (e.g., [SD-JWT-VC] issuer metadata).
4. Verify that the `iss` claim matches the Credential Issuer Identifier of the targeted PaSO Credential.
5. Verify that the `exp` claim has not passed.
6. Verify the credential binding as defined in Section 7 step 6.
7. Verify that the `transaction_data_type` claim equals the `type` of the enclosing `transaction_data` entry.

If any step fails, the ad-hoc metadata JWT **SHALL** be considered invalid and the `transaction_data` entry **SHALL** be considered incompatible for the targeted credential per [PaSO Core] Section 7.4.2. The Wallet **SHALL NOT** fall back to the stored credential metadata entry for a `transaction_data` entry whose `metadata` parameter fails verification.

### 5.4 Precedence and Processing

A successfully verified ad-hoc metadata JWT is authoritative for the enclosing `transaction_data` entry:

- Its `metadata` object **SHALL** be used in place of the corresponding `transaction_data_types` entry from the signed credential metadata JWT, for this transaction only.
- A transaction data type covered by a valid ad-hoc metadata JWT **SHALL** be considered supported by the targeted credential for the purposes of [PaSO Core] Section 7, even if it is absent from the signed credential metadata.

If the ad-hoc metadata does not contain `display` entries for any locale compatible with the Wallet's locale priority list, the Wallet **MAY** treat the `transaction_data` entry as incompatible.

The Wallet **SHALL NOT** persist ad-hoc metadata JWTs beyond the processing of the transaction they accompany. Sections 6 and 8 do not apply to ad-hoc metadata JWTs. Because ad-hoc metadata is delivered within the presentation request, its use involves no additional network retrieval and is not subject to the linkability considerations of Section 8.

### 5.5 Security Considerations

_**Note**: This section is **informative**._

The ad-hoc metadata JWT is delivered by the Relying Party, an untrusted channel; the verification in Section 5.3 is what establishes that the metadata originates from the credential's issuer. The guarantee rests on the credential binding (step 6), not on the signature alone. When the credential's issuer keys are x5c-based:

- The signature (step 2) only proves possession of the private key matching the leaf certificate in the JWT's `x5c` header; the trust store check (step 3) only narrows the signer to an entity vetted by a trusted CA.
- The credential binding pins the signer to this credential's issuer: the JWT's certificate chain must terminate in the same root CA as the credential's own chain, and the Subject of the JWT's leaf certificate must match the Subject of the credential's leaf certificate. Since the credential's chain was verified at issuance, it serves as the anchor for the issuer's identity.

To forge ad-hoc metadata, an attacker would need a certificate issued under the same trusted root CA with the same Subject as the issuer's credential-signing certificate. A trusted root CA issuing a same-Subject certificate to a different entity constitutes a CA compromise, at which point the credential itself would be equally forgeable; the ad-hoc channel therefore adds no trust assumptions beyond those already made for the signed credential metadata JWT (Section 7 step 6).

When the credential's issuer keys are instead published in a key set, the binding rests on the key-set branch of Section 7 step 6: the JWT must verify under a key from the same issuer key set that verifies the credential itself. Forging ad-hoc metadata then requires inserting a key into the issuer's published key set, at which point the credential itself would be equally forgeable; this path likewise adds no trust assumptions beyond those already made for the credential.

The binding deliberately does not require the same key as the credential: the Attestation Provider may use a dedicated metadata-signing key, provided its certificate is issued under the same root CA with the same Subject (x5c case) or the key is published in the same issuer key set (key set case). The `iss` claim check (step 4) is a consistency check on top of the key binding, not a substitute for it.

## 6 Storage and Handling

The Wallet **SHALL** persist signed credential metadata JWTs in their signed form and **SHALL NOT** persist the decoded credential metadata. The Wallet **MAY** store multiple signed metadata JWTs per credential to cover different locales. Each time the Wallet loads a metadata JWT from storage, it **SHALL** perform the full verification procedure defined in Section 7.

If a stored metadata JWT fails verification upon loading (e.g., due to expiry or corruption), the Wallet **SHALL** discard it and re-fetch and verify it per Section 7. The Wallet **SHALL NOT** proceed with any PaSO operation for that credential until a valid metadata JWT covering the required locale is obtained.

## 7 Verification

The Wallet **SHALL** perform the following verification each time it needs to rely on a signed credential metadata JWT:

1. Verify that the `typ` JOSE header parameter is `credential-metadata+jwt`.
2. Verify the JWT signature.
3. Verify the signing key trust:
   - When the credential's issuer keys are x5c-based, verify the `x5c` certificate chain in the JOSE header against the Wallet's trust store.
   - Otherwise, verify that the JWT is signed by a key from the credential issuer's published key set, identified by the `kid` JOSE header parameter and resolved via the credential format's issuer-key mechanism (e.g., [SD-JWT-VC] issuer metadata).
4. Verify that the `iss` claim matches the Credential Issuer Identifier.
5. Verify that the `exp` claim has not passed.
6. Verify the credential binding:
   - The `sub` claim **SHALL** match the credential's type identifier as defined by the credential format: the `vct` claim of the credential for [SD-JWT-VC], or the `docType` of the mobile security object (MSO) for [mdoc]. The device-signed namespace `urn:paso:sca:1` ([PaSO Core] Section 6.3) is not a credential type identifier and **SHALL NOT** be accepted as a `sub` value.
   - When the credential carries an `x5c` certificate chain:
     - The root CA in the metadata JWT's `x5c` chain **SHALL** be the same as the root CA in the credential's `x5c` chain.
     - The Subject of the leaf certificate in the metadata JWT's `x5c` chain **SHALL** match the Subject of the leaf certificate in the credential's `x5c` chain.
   - When the credential does not carry an `x5c` certificate chain, the metadata JWT **SHALL** have been verified per step 3 using a key from the same issuer key set that verifies the credential itself, and the `iss` claim **SHALL** equal the credential's issuer identifier.

If any step fails, the metadata JWT **SHALL** be considered invalid and the Wallet **SHALL** exclude the credential from further processing. During issuance, the Wallet **SHALL** reject the issuance and inform the user.

## 8 Renewal and Unlinkability

Upon fetching a signed credential metadata JWT, the Wallet **SHALL** verify that the `credential_metadata_uri` claim matches the URI from which the JWT was retrieved, after following any HTTP redirects. If they do not match, the JWT **SHALL** be considered invalid per Section 6. The Wallet **SHALL** use the `credential_metadata_uri` claim of the most recently verified JWT for subsequent renewals, allowing the Attestation Provider to relocate the endpoint via HTTP redirects.

The Wallet **SHALL** renew each signed credential metadata JWT before its `exp` time by re-fetching from the `credential_metadata_uri`, and **MAY** re-fetch at any other time. The Wallet **MAY** fetch additional locales by issuing separate requests with different `Accept-Language` headers during renewal.

Credential metadata retrieval **SHALL NOT** be linkable to credential usage. The Wallet **SHALL NOT** fetch credential metadata immediately before or after a presentation in a pattern that would allow a network observer to correlate the two activities.

### A.5 Ad-hoc Metadata JWT Payload for an mdoc Credential

The same ad-hoc mechanism targeting a PaSO Credential in `mso_mdoc` format. Only `sub` and `format` differ from A.4: `sub` carries the credential's `docType` per Section 5.2 — not a `vct`, and not the device-signed namespace `urn:paso:sca:1` from [PaSO Core] Section 6.3. The `transaction_data_type` is unchanged, since transaction data type identifiers are format-independent.

```json
{
  "iss": "https://issuer.bank.example",
  "sub": "com.example.bank.paymentcard.1",
  "format": "mso_mdoc",
  "iat": 1710000000,
  "exp": 1710604800,
  "transaction_data_type": "urn:paso:sca:global:payment:1",
  "metadata": {
    "claims": [
      {
        "path": ["amount"],
        "mandatory": true,
        "value_type": "iso_currency_amount",
        "display": [
          { "locale": "en", "name": "Amount" },
          { "locale": "de", "name": "Betrag" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
