# PaSO Core

## Abstract

This document specifies the core structures and processing rules for transaction authentication using [OID4VP] and [OID4VCI]. It defines the roles involved, the governance framework for credentials and transaction data types, the holder binding proof structure, and the transaction data processing pipeline. While designed with payments and Strong Customer Authentication in mind, PaSO is applicable to any domain requiring verifiable, user-consented transactions.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

PaSO (Payments and SCA for OpenID) extends [OID4VP] and [OID4VCI] for verifiable, user-consented transactions. More specifically, it defines a framework to allow using wallets as Strong Customer Authentication and payment means in the context of [PSD2]. [OID4VP] defines the `transaction_data` parameter but leaves its processing, display, and proof semantics open. PaSO fills these gaps with a minimum viable set of structures and rules.

This document, PaSO Core, defines:

- the roles participating in a PaSO transaction,
- what Credential Rulebooks and Transaction Data Type Rulebooks are,
- the holder binding proof structure produced by the Wallet,
- the transaction data processing pipeline.

### 1.2 Scope

PaSO Core does not define metadata infrastructure (serving, signing, or discovery of credential metadata), rendering implementations, transaction logging, or trust establishment. These are addressed by other PaSO specifications.

The Wallet and the Attestation Provider are expected to agree on a mechanism to ensure the integrity of the Wallet environment. A common approach is a long-lived wallet unit attestation that is revoked if integrity can no longer be guaranteed.

### 1.3 Requirements Notation

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and [RFC8174] when, and only when, they are written in all capital letters.

### 1.4 Terminology

| Term                                 | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PaSO Credential                      | A credential used with PaSO. Issued by an Attestation Provider into a Wallet and presented to a Relying Party with transaction data and a holder binding proof.                                                                                                                        |
| Dynamic Linking                      | The cryptographic binding of transaction-specific data to the presentation proof, ensuring that the data the user consented to is tamper-evident and verifiable. In the context of [PSD2] Article 97(2), this specifically requires linking to a specific amount and a specific payee. |
| Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) | Authentication using at least two elements from different categories (knowledge, possession, inherence) that are independent of each other, per [PSD2] Article 97.                                                                                                                     |
| Credential Rulebook                  | A governance document that defines the rules for issuing, displaying, and verifying a credential type. See Section 4.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Transaction Data Type Rulebook       | A governance document that defines the semantic meaning and structure of a specific transaction data type. See Section 5.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Risk Signal Profile                  | A published governance document that bundles risk signal types — defined in [PaSO Risk Signal Registry] — with a per-signal requirement flag and an optional freshness bound. Referenced by signed credential metadata or a Transaction Data Type Rulebook. See [PaSO Risk Signals] Section 3.                          |
| Authorizing Party                    | The party that receives the proof package from the Relying Party, verifies the transaction, and authorizes the action. See Section 2.                                                                                                                                                  |

## 2 Roles

The following roles participate in PaSO transactions:

- **Attestation Provider**: Defined as the Credential Issuer in [OID4VCI]. Issues PaSO Credentials into the Wallet.
- **Wallet**: Defined as the Wallet in [OID4VP]. Stores PaSO Credentials, processes transaction data, and produces the holder binding proof.
- **Relying Party**: Defined as the Verifier in [OID4VP]. Sends presentation requests containing transaction data and receives the verifiable presentation.
- **Authorizing Party**: The party that ultimately authorizes the transaction. It receives the proof package from the Relying Party and verifies it in conjunction with the original presentation request. The Authorizing Party has a trust relationship with the Attestation Provider and the Relying Party.

## 3 Flows

Two common flow types are expected in the PaSO ecosystem:

- **First-party flow**: A single party fulfils the roles of Attestation Provider, Relying Party, and Authorizing Party. The Wallet presents the PaSO Credential back to the party that issued it.

- **Third-party flow**: The Relying Party is distinct from the Attestation Provider and Authorizing Party. The Wallet presents the PaSO Credential to the Relying Party, which forwards the proof package to the Authorizing Party.

The Relying Party **SHALL** send a signed [OID4VP] Authorization Request (Request Object per [JAR]). The Wallet **SHALL** reject unsigned PaSO presentation requests.

## 4 Credential Rulebooks

### 4.1 Purpose

A Credential Rulebook is a governance document that defines the rules for a specific PaSO Credential type. Every PaSO Credential type **SHOULD** have a Credential Rulebook.

### 4.2 Contents

A Credential Rulebook **MAY** specify:

- The nature of a PaSO Credential and its applicable contexts,
- attribute structures for the PaSO Credential,
- display rules for the credential in the Wallet,
- references to one or more Transaction Data Type Rulebooks,
- policies for Attestation Providers and Relying Parties,
- issuance requirements (e.g., validity period, binding to wallet attestations),
- verification requirements for the Relying Party and Authorizing Party,
- the embedded disclosure policy, if applicable.

Attestation Providers and Relying Parties **SHALL** follow the applicable Credential Rulebook.

## 5 Transaction Data Type Rulebooks

### 5.1 Purpose

A Transaction Data Type Rulebook is a governance document that defines a specific transaction data type. It specifies the semantic meaning of all claims and all UI display requirements.

Every transaction data type identifier used with PaSO **SHALL** have a Transaction Data Type Rulebook published by the organisation that owns the identifier.

### 5.2 Type Identifiers

Each PaSO transaction data type is identified by a URN following this structure:

```
urn:paso:sca:<domain>:<suffix>:<version>
```

Where:

- `<domain>` is an organisation identifier in reverse domain notation (e.g., `com.example`), or `global` for transaction data types defined by PaSO itself,
- `<suffix>` is one or more colon-separated segments identifying the type (e.g., `payment`),
- `<version>` is a version number (e.g., `1`). It **SHALL** be a positive integer without leading zeros and **SHALL** be the final segment of the identifier. New versions of a transaction data type **SHALL** use monotonically increasing integers.

The Wallet identifies PaSO transaction data entries by checking whether the `type` field starts with the prefix `urn:paso:sca:`.

### 5.3 Rulebook Requirements

A Transaction Data Type Rulebook **SHALL** define, for each claim in the transaction data type:

- the semantic meaning of the claim,
- whether the claim is required or optional in the transaction payload,
- whether the claim must be displayed to the user,
- how the claim value is to be rendered when displayed.

A Transaction Data Type Rulebook **MAY** also define the localised UI labels for the consent screen, including at minimum a label for the confirmation action.

These definitions constitute the **semantic structure** of the transaction data type. For any given type identifier, the semantic structure **SHALL** be immutable once published. Changes to the semantic structure **SHALL** require a new version of the type identifier.

The Wallet **SHALL** ensure that all claims designated for display have been shown to the user before enabling the confirmation action.

### 5.4 Content Quality

All text displayed to the user **SHALL** be short and easily understandable.

## 6 Holder Binding Proof

### 6.1 SCA Response Claims

The Wallet **SHALL** include the following claims in every PaSO Credential presentation that involves transaction data, embedded in the format-specific proof structure that cryptographically binds the user's consent to the presentation.

| Claim                       | Required    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `jti`                       | yes         | A fresh, cryptographically random value with sufficient entropy per [RFC7519] Section 4.1.7. Unique per presentation. When used for SCA, serves as the Authentication Code per [PSD2].                                                        |
| `display_locale`            | yes         | A [RFC5646] language tag representing the locale shown to the user during consent. Enables deterministic reconstruction of which display entries were used.                                                                                   |
| `transaction_data_hash`     | yes         | Hash of the base64url-encoded `transaction_data` entry selected for the PaSO Credential.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `transaction_data_hash_alg` | yes         | Hash algorithm identifier. Default: `sha-256`.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `metadata_integrity`        | conditional | The [W3C.SRI] integrity value of the signed credential metadata JWT (per [PaSO Proof Metadata]) used to display the transaction data during this presentation. **REQUIRED** when a signed credential metadata JWT was used; absent otherwise. |
| `request_integrity`         | yes         | The [W3C.SRI] integrity value of the signed [OID4VP] Authorization Request ([JAR] Request Object) as received by the Wallet, computed over the compact-serialised JWT string.                                                                 |
| `wallet_instance_version`   | yes         | Version identifier of the Wallet application that authorized the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `risk_signals`              | conditional | An array of risk-signal envelopes per [PaSO Risk Signals]. **REQUIRED** when the signal set resolved for the matched transaction data type contains one or more required signals, per [PaSO Risk Signals] Section 4.1; absent otherwise. Signal types are defined by [PaSO Risk Signal Registry]. When encryption is required for the transaction data type, this value is an encrypted structure per [PaSO Risk Signals] instead of a plaintext array. |

The authentication methods used to release the transaction, and the `response_mode` of the Authorization Request, are not claims of this section. They are risk signal types defined by [PaSO Risk Signal Registry] and are carried inside `risk_signals` when a referenced risk signal profile requires them. A PaSO transaction therefore evidences Strong Customer Authentication only where the risk signal profile in force requires the authentication-methods signal; this specification does not require it.

### 6.2 SD-JWT-VC Profile

For PaSO Credentials in [SD-JWT-VC] format, the Wallet **SHALL** include a Key Binding JWT (KB-JWT). The SCA response claims from Section 6.1 **SHALL** be included as top-level claims in the KB-JWT payload, in addition to the standard KB-JWT claims defined by [OID4VP].

### 6.3 mdoc Profile

For PaSO Credentials in [mdoc] format, the Wallet **SHALL** include device authentication. The SCA response claims **SHALL** be included as device-signed data elements in the `DeviceNameSpaces` structure under the namespace `urn:paso:sca:1`.

| Data element                | CBOR type     |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| `jti`                       | tstr          |
| `display_locale`            | tstr          |
| `transaction_data_hash`     | bstr          |
| `transaction_data_hash_alg` | tstr          |
| `metadata_integrity`        | tstr          |
| `request_integrity`         | tstr          |
| `wallet_instance_version`   | tstr          |
| `risk_signals`              | array of maps |

## 7 Transaction Data Processing

### 7.1 Transaction Data Object

PaSO extends the [OID4VP] `transaction_data` entry with the following parameter:

- **`payload`**: **REQUIRED**. A JSON object containing the transaction details. The structure is defined by the applicable Transaction Data Type Rulebook for the matching `type`.

### 7.2 Locale Selection

Locale selection **SHALL** follow the Lookup matching scheme defined in [RFC4647] Section 3.4. The locale used for selection **SHALL** be reported in the `display_locale` claim (Section 6.1).

### 7.3 Simple Profile

The simple profile is the minimum PaSO transaction data processing mode and a minimal subset of the advanced profile. All Wallets supporting PaSO **SHALL** implement the simple profile. A Wallet implementing the advanced profile is fully compatible with requests made in the simple profile.

In the simple profile, the presentation request contains exactly one PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entry, identified by a `type` starting with `urn:paso:sca:`, whose `credential_ids` **SHALL** contain exactly one credential query identifier. When `credential_sets` are used, the PaSO-targeted credential **SHALL** be required in all alternatives. The Wallet **MAY** reject non-trivial credential set configurations.

The Wallet **SHALL**:

1. Identify the credential matching the single credential query identifier in `credential_ids`.
2. Verify that the entry's `type` is supported by that credential and that the `payload` conforms to the applicable Transaction Data Type Rulebook. If not, the Wallet **SHALL** cease processing and inform the user.
3. Display the transaction data to the user for consent.
4. If the user consents, proceed with the presentation.

### 7.4 Advanced Profile

The advanced profile applies when the presentation request contains multiple PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entries, multiple credential alternatives, or uses DCQL credential sets. Wallets **MAY** implement the advanced profile. Credential Rulebooks and Transaction Data Type Rulebooks **MAY** require that the Wallet supports the advanced profile.

A Wallet that does not support the advanced profile **SHALL** reject a presentation request that contains more than one PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entry or that uses `credential_sets` involving non-trivial PaSO-targeted entries, and **SHALL** inform the user.

#### 7.4.1 Transaction Data and DCQL Credential Sets

The presentation request **MAY** contain multiple PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entries.

When `credential_sets` are used in the DCQL query ([OID4VP] Section 6.2), all credential query identifiers referenced by PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entries' `credential_ids` **SHALL** appear within options of the same credential set.

Each inner array within the `options` of the credential set (hereafter called an **alternative**) lists credential query identifiers that **MUST** all be presented together. An alternative **resolves to** a PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entry if it contains a credential query identifier listed in that entry's `credential_ids`. When an alternative resolves to multiple PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entries for the same credential, the Wallet **SHALL** apply the first-match selection rule from Section 7.4.2 step 2.

All alternatives that involve a PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entry **SHALL** be **transposable**. Transposability means that the user's credential choices must be fully independent of each other. Selecting one credential should never constrain which credentials are available in another slot.

Concretely: it must be possible to decompose the alternatives into a set of independent credential slots _S₁_, _S₂_, …, _Sₖ_, where each slot represents one independent choice the user makes. Each slot contains the credentials the user can pick for that choice, and may also allow the user to pick nothing (making that slot optional). The full list of PaSO-targeted alternatives must be exactly the result of combining every possible selection across all slots.

A Relying Party **SHALL** construct its alternatives so that this holds. If a Wallet detects that the alternatives cannot be decomposed this way, meaning some credential choices are artificially coupled, it **SHALL** stop processing and inform the user.

Alternatives that do not involve any PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entry are not subject to this requirement.

The Wallet **SHALL** present the PaSO-targeted alternatives to the user as independent choices, one per credential slot. For each slot the user selects one of the available credentials, or none if ∅ is present in that slot. When alternatives resolve to different `transaction_data` entries, the Wallet **SHALL** display the transaction data corresponding to the user's current credential selection. When the user changes a selection that causes a different `transaction_data` entry to apply, the Wallet **SHALL** update the displayed transaction data accordingly.

The ordering of alternatives expresses the Relying Party's preference: the Wallet **SHOULD** derive the display order for each slot from the order in which credential query identifiers first appear across the alternatives. The Wallet **SHOULD** default to the first alternative's selection for each slot, but **MAY** override the default with a credential the user has previously selected in the same context, provided the slot's display order remains as defined by the request.

This first-match rule allows a Relying Party to provide versioned transaction data: a newer `type` can be listed first in the `transaction_data` array, with an older `type` as a fallback for credentials that do not yet support it.

A presentation request **MAY** combine PaSO Credentials with non-PaSO credentials.

#### 7.4.2 Discovery and Validation

After resolution, exactly one `transaction_data` entry **SHALL** apply to the selected credential. The presentation request **MAY** contain multiple PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entries provided they conform to the rules in Section 7.4.1.

For the PaSO-targeted entries, the Wallet **SHALL** perform the following steps:

1. The Wallet **SHALL** identify all credentials matching the presentation request that are PaSO Credentials. A credential is a candidate for a PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entry if the credential matches a credential query whose identifier is listed in that entry's `credential_ids`.
2. For each candidate credential, the Wallet **SHALL** select the first PaSO-targeted `transaction_data` entry (in array order) that targets that credential via `credential_ids`, whose `type` is among the transaction data types supported by that credential, and whose `payload` conforms to the rulebook definition for that type. A `payload` conforms if it does not contain fields not declared by the rulebook, all fields declared as required are present, all display formatting directives are supported by the Wallet, and all values conform to their declared formatting. If no entry is compatible, the credential **SHALL** be excluded.
3. For each candidate credential, where the selected entry's `payload` contains claims that require resolution of an external resource with integrity verification, the Wallet **SHALL** resolve and verify them. If resolution or verification fails, the `transaction_data` entry **SHALL** be considered incompatible and the Wallet **SHALL** resume the selection in step 2 for the affected credential, continuing with the next `transaction_data` entry in array order that targets that credential. If no compatible entry remains for the credential, the credential **SHALL** be excluded.
4. If at any point during the processing of this section no compatible credentials remain, the Wallet **SHALL** cease processing and inform the user.
5. The Wallet **SHALL** present the remaining compatible credentials as alternatives to the user. For the initially selected credential, the Wallet **SHALL** display the `transaction_data` entry matched in step 2.
6. If the user selects a different credential, the Wallet **SHALL** display the `transaction_data` entry matched for that credential in step 2. When the matched `transaction_data` entry differs between credentials, the displayed content **SHALL** update accordingly.
7. If the user consents, the Wallet **MAY** proceed with the presentation.

## Annex A: Examples

_**Note**: This annex is **informative**._

### A.1 Presentation Request

An [OID4VP] presentation request with PaSO transaction data. The `transaction_data` entry is shown decoded; in the actual request it is base64url-encoded.

**DCQL query:**

```json
{
  "dcql_query": {
    "credentials": [
      {
        "id": "sca_card",
        "format": "dc+sd-jwt",
        "meta": { "vct_values": ["https://bank.example/sca/card"] },
        "claims": [
          { "path": ["pan_last_four"] },
          { "path": ["scheme"] }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Decoded `transaction_data` entry:**

```json
{
  "type": "urn:paso:sca:global:payment:1",
  "credential_ids": ["sca_card"],
  "payload": {
    "transaction_id": "ab9c4d5e-6f78-9012-3456-789abcdef012",
    "amount": "49.99 EUR",
    "payee": {
      "name": "Shop Inc.",
      "id": "DE98ZZZ09999999999"
    }
  }
}
```

### A.2 KB-JWT Payload (SD-JWT-VC)

This example assumes a risk signal profile requiring the `response_mode` and authentication-methods signals is in force; absent such a profile the `risk_signals` claim would be absent.

```json
{
  "aud": "x509_san_dns:shop.example.com",

      "status": "ok",
      "value": "direct_post.jwt"
    },
    {
      "type": "urn:paso:risk:global:amr:1",
      "collected_at": "2026-07-24T10:15:30Z",
      "status": "ok",
      "value": ["pin", "hwk", "bio_strong", "face"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### A.4 Consent Screen

How a Wallet might display the transaction from Annex A.1 with locale `en`:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Payment Confirmation                    │
│                                          │
│  Amount            49.99 EUR             │
│  Payee             Shop Inc.             │
│                                          │
│  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐      │
│  │     Pay      │  │    Cancel    │      │
│  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### A.5 Advanced Profile — Multiple Transaction Data Entries

A Relying Party accepts either a card or an account PaSO Credential, and optionally a PID. Each `transaction_data` entry targets a different credential via `credential_ids`:

```json
{
  "dcql_query": {
    "credentials": [
      {
        "id": "sca_card",
        "format": "dc+sd-jwt",
        "meta": { "vct_values": ["https://bank.example/sca/card"] }
      },
      {
        "id": "sca_account",
        "format": "dc+sd-jwt",
        "meta": { "vct_values": ["https://bank.example/sca/account"] }
      },
      {
        "id": "pid",
        "format": "dc+sd-jwt",
        "meta": { "vct_values": ["https://credentials.example/pid"] },
        "claims": [
          { "path": ["given_name"] },
          { "path": ["family_name"] }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "credential_sets": [
      {
        "options": [
          ["sca_card", "pid"],
          ["sca_card"],
          ["sca_account", "pid"],
          ["sca_account"]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Decoded `transaction_data` entries:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "urn:paso:sca:global:payment:1",
    "credential_ids": ["sca_card"],
    "payload": {
      "transaction_id": "ab9c4d5e-6f78-9012-3456-789abcdef012",
      "amount": "49.99 EUR",
      "payee": { "name": "Shop Inc.", "id": "DE98ZZZ09999999999" }
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "urn:paso:sca:global:payment:1",
    "credential_ids": ["sca_account"],
    "payload": {
      "transaction_id": "ab9c4d5e-6f78-9012-3456-789abcdef012",
      "amount": "49.99 EUR",
      "payee": { "name": "Shop Inc.", "id": "DE98ZZZ09999999999" }
    }
  }
]
```

The four alternatives decompose into _S₁_ = {`sca_card`, `sca_account`}, _S₂_ = {`pid`, ∅}. The user independently chooses which PaSO Credential to use and whether to include the PID. When the user switches from `sca_card` to `sca_account`, the displayed transaction data updates to reflect the entry matched for that credential.

### A.6 Advanced Profile — Transposability

_**Example (transposable):**_ A Relying Party accepts one PaSO Credential (`sca_card`) and optionally requests a PID from two possible issuers (`pid_1` and `pid_2`):

```json
"options": [
  ["sca_card", "pid_1"],
  ["sca_card", "pid_2"],
  ["sca_card"]
]
```

This decomposes into _S₁_ = {`sca_card`}, _S₂_ = {`pid_1`, `pid_2`, ∅}. The user is presented two independent choices: `sca_card` (mandatory), and optionally which PID to include.

---

_**Counterexample (not transposable):**_ The Relying Party also optionally accepts a `loyalty` credential, but only in combination with `pid_2`:

```json
"options": [
  ["sca_card", "pid_1"],
  ["sca_card", "pid_2", "loyalty"],
  ["sca_card"]
]
```

The only candidate decomposition would be _S₁_ = {`sca_card`}, _S₂_ = {`pid_1`, `pid_2`, ∅}, _S₃_ = {`loyalty`, ∅}, which requires six alternatives, not three. The Relying Party has created an artificial dependency between `loyalty` and `pid_2`. A Wallet **SHALL** reject this request.

To make it transposable, the Relying Party must include all six combinations:

```json
"options": [
  ["sca_card", "pid_1", "loyalty"],
  ["sca_card", "pid_1"],
  ["sca_card", "pid_2", "loyalty"],
  ["sca_card", "pid_2"],
  ["sca_card", "loyalty"],
  ["sca_card"]
]
```

### A.7 Advanced Profile — Versioned Transaction Data

A Relying Party has migrated its transaction type from version 1 to version 2, which adds an optional `reward_points` claim. The Relying Party lists the newer type first so that credentials supporting it use the richer payload, while older credentials fall back to v1:

Decoded `transaction_data` entries:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "urn:paso:sca:com.example.pay:transaction:2",
    "credential_ids": ["sca"],
    "payload": {
      "transaction_id": "ab9c4d5e-6f78-9012-3456-789abcdef012",
      "amount": "49.99 EUR",
      "payee": { "name": "Example Shop", "id": "DE98ZZZ09999999999" },
      "reward_points": "150"
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "urn:paso:sca:com.example.pay:transaction:1",
    "credential_ids": ["sca"],
    "payload": {
      "transaction_id": "ab9c4d5e-6f78-9012-3456-789abcdef012",
      "amount": "49.99 EUR",
      "payee": { "name": "Example Shop", "id": "DE98ZZZ09999999999" }
    }
  }
]
```

Both entries target the same `credential_ids`. When the Wallet evaluates the user's credential:

- If the credential supports `urn:paso:sca:com.example.pay:transaction:2`, the first entry matches and is selected.
- If the credential only supports `urn:paso:sca:com.example.pay:transaction:1`, the first entry is skipped and the second entry is selected.

This allows the Relying Party to roll out a new transaction data version without breaking compatibility with credentials that have not yet been updated.
